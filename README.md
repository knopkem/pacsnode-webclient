DICOM WebViewer (vanilla js)

My old custom DICOM viewer written when cornerstone, ohif and dicomweb were in its infancy.
It transfers files using 2 lossless png (low and high bit 16bit values) and requests metadata similar to dicomweb now.
It was designed with mobile in mind and comes with a couple of measurements.

It's used here: https://github.com/knopkem/pacsnode-server
